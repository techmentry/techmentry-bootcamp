# Welcome to the Bootcamp

Hello there student/ teacher/ parent or anyone reading this text. We at Techmentry have tried to curate some basic information that you might find useful during and after this bootcamp. We want you to enjoy coding as much as we do,
however, we do understand that it can be daunting and comes with a steep learning curve at the beginning. Having gone through that ourselves, we want to make this process easier and smoother for you. Definitely not spoon feed you,
but point you to resources that we have found to be useful.

> Note: The objective of this bootcamp and content here is definitely not to teach you Python. We cannot and will not claim to teach you python in a measly 1 hour a day, for 3 days. Instead, we want to give you a feel
> for how Python can be used, and what for by taking a couple of real life examples. By no means are these demonstration examples exhaustive. Python is used in a variety of domains - research in popular fundamental science spaces likes biology (stem cell simulation, genetic algorithms, understanding diseases, simulating and calculating artificial life etc), physics (universe simulations, optics, simulations for our own planet) and needless to say mathematics for almost everything.
> It is also extremely pervasive in finance, banking, and in general an extremely handy tools while working with large data sets and repetitive operations.
> Data science uses Python heavily now a days to generate reports, analyse data and create stats and build some AI models to take certain actions on these. Platforms like Raspberry PI, a micro-controller based embedded platform,
> allows you to program some cool IoT and robotics applications using Python and libraries like OpenCV for computer vision.
> __However__, we have tried to provide you with a short and useful intro to Python syntax in our day 1 collection of Python samples (please check the src folder above). Hope this interests you as much as it does us.

## What does this repository have?

This repository will have all the guides, source code, and setup manuals that you will need for your 3 day bootcamp. We well understand that 3 hours are not enough to cover a ginormous and mature language like Python, we want
you to have some resources to take back home, and work with.

## Sitemap

Here is a basic layout of what you can find, and where you can find it.

* Please check out the [setup](/setup) page. This should hold all the software installation guides related to our bootcamp.
* Please check out the [guides](/guides) page. This should hold all the knowledge guides related to our bootcamp and beyond.
* Please check out the [src](/src) page. This should hold all the source code and programs we will write during our bootcamp. This way, you have something to refer back to after our bootcamp.

## Where do I start?

I would recommend this order for the best results before our session.

1. Install Python. Please check this [guide](setup/python-setup.md) to find out how.
2. Install Visual Studio Code. Please check this [guide](setup/vscode-setup.md) to find out how.
3. Read up on command line basics. Checkout [this guide](guides/command-line-interface.md) we have curated for you.

It is okay if you don't get all of this at once. We will try to tackle some of this during our sessions.

Hope to see you soon.

Best,

The Techmentry Team.
