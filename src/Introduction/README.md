# Introductory code

Please look at some Introductory source code which will help you get accustomed to programming in Python

- [Basics](./python-sample-0.py)
- [Input and output](./python-sample-1-1.py)
- [Conditions, loops and functions](./python-sample-1-2.py)
- [Sample programs - physics and math quantities](./python-sample-1-3.py)

One you are done with this, please take a look at the [practice sheet](./python-practice-1-1.py)

To run any of these programs yourself, open "Command Prompt" or Terminal on your machine. 
Post that, run the following command

```bash
python --version
```
If the above command DOES NOT work, try the one below.

```bash
python3 --version
```

If both of these do not work, please take a look at the Python setup document we have created for you, [here](../../../techmentry-bootcamp/setup/python-setup.md)

Once you are done with the setup, try running the above command on your machine. If they work you are good to go.
Note what works for you `python` or `python3`. You will be using this run your programs ahead.

Type the following command to run your program

```bash
python3 <file_name.py>
```

For example if I have to run [Sample program 3](./python-sample-1-3.py), I will run

```bash
cd /Users/sarthaktickoo/Work/Bloombench/bootcamp/techmentry-bootcamp/src/Introduction/
python3 python-sample-1-3.py
```

Note that `/Users/sarthaktickoo/Work/Bloombench/bootcamp/techmentry-bootcamp/src/Introduction/` is where I have downloaded my files. Yours could be at a different location and you need to give that folder path.
e.g. yours could be in the folder `C:\Data\PythonBootCamp\src\Introduction`

In which case you would do

```bash
cd C:\Data\PythonBootCamp\src\Introduction
python3 python-sample-1-3.py
```
