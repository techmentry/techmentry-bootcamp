# Source code section

This area will be used to store all the source code for our Python bootcamp.

## Day 1

Please look at some source code checked in for Day 1 related items

- [Basics](./python-sample-0.py)
- [Input and output](./python-sample-1-1.py)
- [Conditions, loops and functions](./python-sample-1-2.py)
- [Sample programs - physics and math quantities](./python-sample-1-3.py)

One you are done with this, please take a look at the [practice sheet](python-practice-1-1.py).

## Day 2

Please find the day 2 source code illustrating how a dodging game could look in python using pygame, here.
I would strongly suggest reading up content on Day 1 and practicing some code. Otherwise a lot of syntax will feel very strange and alien to you.
