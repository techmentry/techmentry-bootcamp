# Source code section

This area will be used to store all the source code for our Python bootcamp.

## How to read code here?

Please open source code files and read through them. Source code is added, and sufficiently annotated with comments. All files are runnable out of the box.

## Introduction

Please look at [introductory code](./Introduction/README.md) that we have created for you to learn some basics about Python.

Once you are comfortable with some python syntax and what you can do with it, please take a look at the [practice sheet](./Introduction/python-practice-1-1.py).

## Sample Pygame game

Please find an [example](./Sample_Pygame/README.md) which creates a small dodging game using a popular python gaming module called `pygame`.

## Sample Data Analysis

This deals with a real life use of Python, and currently an extremely popular one - data analysis and visualization.
You can find all of the code and some data files [here](./Sample_DataAnalysis/README.md).

## Sample Web Server

This deals with another real life use of Python - web servers using `flask`.
You can find all of the code and some data files [here](./Sample_WebServer/README.md).
