# Sample dodging game using `pygame`

The source code illustrating how a dodging game could look in python using pygame, [here](./python-sample-2-1.py).
I would strongly suggest reading up our [introductory content](../Introduction/README.md), and practicing some code. 

**Otherwise a lot of syntax will feel very strange and alien to you.**

* Please follow the instructions in the code file.
* After you have installed `pygame`, you can then run the module as

```bash
cd /Users/sarthaktickoo/Work/Bloombench/bootcamp/techmentry-bootcamp/src/Sample_Pygame
python3 python-sample-2-1.py
```

If this fails, run

```bash
cd /Users/sarthaktickoo/Work/Bloombench/bootcamp/techmentry-bootcamp/src/Sample_Pygame
python python-sample-2-1.py
```

>**Note**: `/Users/sarthaktickoo/Work/Bloombench/bootcamp/techmentry-bootcamp/src/Sample_Pygame/` is where I have downloaded my files.
>Yours could be at a different location and you need to give that folder path.
>e.g. yours could be in the folder `C:\Data\PythonBootCamp\src\Sample_Pygame`
>In which case you would do

>```bash
>cd C:\Data\PythonBootCamp\src\Sample_Pygame
>python python-sample-2-1.py
>```
