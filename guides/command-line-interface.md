# Command line interfaces

Command line interface (CLI) to anyone can look extremely daunting because it is an eerily empty text-only screen, with no UI elements like buttons and menus that we have gotten used to. However, it is an extremely powerful tool,
which can allow you to do a number of things with great ease which would be insanely difficult to do with a UI. This might seem counter-intuitive, but imagine being able to write pseudo-english like sentences, hitting enter and boom! You have operated on a million files in a folder (yes, it is possible).

## TL;DR

What is CLI? It is a text based command tool, which accepts a set of commands in a certain format. These commands can be OS commands or programs in general, and you are indirectly interacting with the OS itself through a CLI.

Doesn't seem so bad does it? Want to learn more? read on.

## What is a CLI

I came across [this link](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-cli) which explains the history behind the CLI, and what a modern CLI does and is capable of. I would urge you to read it.

### Are CLIs different on different platforms?

Yes. Very much so. Each operating system has it's own version of CLI. Most notably, Microsoft Windows (Based on MS DOS) and Unix based systems are the 2 major categories of CLI.
Mac (OSX)(based on FreeBSD), Linux (based on a open source Unix like implementation) are all derivatives of Unix.

### What does the Microsoft Windows CLI look like? What can it do?

Glad you asked! [Here is a great link](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/) explaining what it is capable of and how to use it.

### What does the MacOS terminal look like? What can it do?

A Apple user? We have you covered. [This post](https://medium.com/@grace.m.nolan/terminal-for-beginners-e492ba10902a) tries to explain what you can do with your terminal.
We are all dummies at some point. Let us learn from a [website](https://www.dummies.com/computers/macs/mac-operating-systems/how-to-use-basic-unix-commands-to-work-in-terminal-on-your-mac/) dedicated to us.
Feeling lucky are we? [Here](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/) you go.

## Is there a place which has a reference and some examples to all of this?

Of course there is. I use [this](https://ss64.com/) extensively, almost on a daily basis. Hope you find it useful!
